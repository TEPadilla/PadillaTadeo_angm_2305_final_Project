# TextBuster: A text-based adventure game

## Repository
https://github.com/TEPadilla/PadillaTadeo_angm_2305_final_Project

## Description
For this project, I will be taking on the 

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Calculates Dice Rolls, as well as gives the ability to add, subtract, multiply (depending on number of die used), and which type of dies to look for (d20, d6, etc.)
- Feature 2
	- The program will rely on user input, having functions for both Randomized results and Calculations to be made together (e.g. 2d6 + 7 = 14)

- Feature N 
	- The program will have an interactable display that plays out a story that relies on the player's input from a selection of options

## Challenges
- Learning how to implment text onto the pygame screen
- Creating an RPG-based choice system that wiil give a range of 2-4 types of responses
- Adding both the randomized die results with operators to do calculations for attacks made by choices

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Creating a basic Roleplaying, text-based game for players to learn what choices they can, and be able go on to write similar works.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Basic Calculator and text inputs work functionally at the minimum in the Terminal

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Have all the implemented to do basic operations and properly import "random" for RNG 
  2. Successfully have a properly running calculator and text-based prompts and choices

- Week 2
  1. Establishing the Interactive Display into Pygame
  2. Choices correlate to their result in Pygame

- Week N (Final)
  1. Hotfix any code needing of appending or have it running proper
  2. Pygame runs without error

## Description
Hi! And welcome to TextBuster!

In this project, I explore creating a short Text-Based Adventure game that implements the ability to select from various choices with their own outcomes, as well as using a form of dice to aid the player, or set them back. The story takes place in the Wild West, you are a passenger on a train that abruptly being taken over by banndits!

The inspiration for this style of a Pygame came from years of playing Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and wanting to create a Computer Role-Playing Game (CRPG). With this in mind, I have implemented both a story, ability checks, and a short turned-based combat system where both the player and the Train Bandits (we'll call our little AI enemies) fight it out to see who wins or loses, involving both die rolling, and a damage and HP system to go along with it.

Along with all this, I as well implemented a "Advantage/Disadvantage" system where when the play is able to get the upper hand on the Bandits, you can have a better chance at taking them by taking one out, and taking the rest by surprise!
